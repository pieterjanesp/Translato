# Project: Document Translator

> **Learning Vehicle** - This project exists to learn software engineering concepts. See the main [[00-index|Knowledge Base]] for generalized patterns.

## Project Overview

A webapp that translates PowerPoint, Word, and PDF documents while preserving formatting and structure.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Frontend | React + TypeScript | Industry standard, type safety |
| Backend | Python FastAPI | Modern, async, leverages existing Python skills |
| File Processing | python-pptx, python-docx, pdfplumber | Mature libraries for document manipulation |
| Translation | LLM API or Translation API | TBD based on quality/cost trade-offs |

## Learning Goals

Through this project, we'll learn:

1. **Architecture** - How to structure a full-stack application
2. **API Design** - RESTful endpoints, file uploads, async responses
3. **Frontend Patterns** - React components, state, TypeScript
4. **File Handling** - Upload, process, download workflows
5. **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages, edge cases
6. **Testing** - How to test file processing and API endpoints
